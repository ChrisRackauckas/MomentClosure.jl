This can be achieved using moment closure approximations (MAs) using which all moments above a certain order m are expressed in terms of m^textth and lower order moments using various (usually distributional) assumptions [1]. Doing so enables us to effectively close the moment hierarchy, leading to a finite set of ODEs which can then be solved numerically. In this section, we present some the commonly used MA methods that are implemented in MomentClosure. Please see the Tutorials section for examples showing different MAs applied to a variety of systems.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/moment_closure_approximations/#Zero-closure","page":"Moment Closure Approximations","title":"Zero closure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/moment_closure_approximations/","page":"Moment Closure Approximations","title":"Moment Closure Approximations","text":"The simplest MA is the \"central-moment-neglect\" MA (CMN-MA) [2], also referred to as \"zero-closure\" [3] or \"low dispersion moment closure\" [4], where CMN-MA at m^textth order means that the moment equations are truncated by setting all central moments above order m to zero.

For example, in case we are truncating the moment equations at 4th order, the truncation-order central moments would be expressed only in terms of covariances whereas our formulation using cumulants would explicitly include information about the computed values of third central moments, which is expected to improve numerical stability and lead to more accurate moment estimates.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/moment_closure_approximations/#Poisson-closure","page":"Moment Closure Approximations","title":"Poisson closure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/moment_closure_approximations/","page":"Moment Closure Approximations","title":"Moment Closure Approximations","text":"Although the Poisson distribution lacks a general formulation for multiple variables [3], \"Poisson MA\" has been formulated [2, 8] assuming that the joint multivariate distribution is a product of univariate Poisson distributions, i.e., n_i sim textPoisson(mu_i).

However, in certain cases the reaction product may itself be a stochastic variable so that the corresponding expectation values, langle S_r^mathbfi-mathbfj rangle, must be taken into account. We have implemented a limited support for such systems where components of S can be independent geometrically distributed variables, see the specific gene network example (FIX LINK).\nGeneration of raw moment equations is only possible if the kinetics of the system at hand are governed by the law of mass action where all propensity functions are polynomials in mathbfn, otherwise the expectation value terms langle a_r(mathbfn) rangle and langle n_i_1^j_1 dotsm n_i_N^j_N a_r(mathbfn) rangle are ill-defined. This key issue can be overcome by the general central moment expansion method presented below.\nThe order of the polynomials a_r(mathbfn) determines the order of moments encountered in the generated system of ODEs. If the system is linear (contains only zeroth and first order reactions), the m^textth order moments will depend only of moments of order m or lower, hence constituting a finite hierarchy of moment ODEs that can be readily solved numerically or otherwise without approximations. However, if the system is non-linear (involves second or higher order reactions), moment equations will depend on higher order moments. For example, if the reaction network contains bimolecular reactions, the corresponding propensity functions will be second order polynomials and hence m^textth order moment equations will now depend on (m+1)^th order moments. This leads to an infinite hierarchy of coupled moment equations where each moment will depend on higher order moments—it cannot be solved directly and needs to be truncated. This can be achieved using one of many moment closure approximations that express (m+1)^textth order moments in terms of m^textth and lower order moments using different distributional assumptions, effectively closing the hierarchy and enabling one to solve the moment equations up to m^textth order [1]. Details of all closure methods currently implemented within the package can be found in (FIX LINK).","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/moment_expansion/#central_moment_eqs","page":"Moment Expansion","title":"Central moment equations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/moment_expansion/","page":"Moment Expansion","title":"Moment Expansion","text":"As we have seen, the moment equations of P(mathbfn t) can be obtained in a straightforward manner if the kinetics of the system are governed by the law of mass action where all propensity functions are polynomials in mathbfn [1].

Nevertheless, we have implemented a limited extension of ModelingToolkit.ReactionSystem, called ReactionSystemMod, that allows us to consider systems containing reactions whose products can be independent geometrically distributed random variables. Note that such systems, one being the gene network example [LINK], are currently not supported by Catalyst. Moreover, ReactionSystemMod provides an alternative to Catalyst as the model is now constructed directly in terms of user-defined reaction propensity functions and the stoichiometric matrix, with system parameters and species defined using ModelingToolkit @parameters and @variables respectively. However, we stress that defining models using Catalyst is preferred whenever possible due to its much richer integration within the broader SciML ecosystem.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/momentclosure_api/","page":"MomentClosure.jl API","title":"MomentClosure.jl API","text":"ModelingToolkit.@parameters\r\nModelingToolkit.@variables\r\nReactionSystemMod","category":"page"},{"location":"api/momentclosure_api/#ModelingToolkit.@parameters","page":"MomentClosure.jl API","title":"ModelingToolkit.@parameters","text":"Define one or more known variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"api/momentclosure_api/#ModelingToolkit.@variables","page":"MomentClosure.jl API","title":"ModelingToolkit.@variables","text":"Define one or more unknown variables.\n\n@parameters t α σ(..) β[1:2]\n@variables w(..) x(t) y() z(t, α, x)\n\nexpr = β₁* x + y^α + σ(3) * (z - t) - β₂ * w(t - 1)\n\nNote that @parameters and @variables implicitly add () to values that are not given a call.
